# Bounty Hunter Hamster

Bounty Hunter Hamster is a web game about a little hamster's adventures. Help him grow stronger, eat seeds, and do whatever hamsters do.

This project is now in progress!

I adore hamsters and I adore Hamtaro so I really wanted to try making a wacky RPG about hamsters.

The reason why I decided on a top down rpg style game was because I wanted to learn how to make a game in that style. I've only been attempting 2d side scrolling games so this is a challenge to myself.
